# SQL Data Warehouse Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server**. It covers the full data lifecycle, including **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes**, **data modeling**, and **analytics**, enabling efficient reporting and data-driven decision-making.

## Features

### 1. Data Integration (ETL)
- Extract data from multiple source systems, including transactional databases, CSV files, and APIs.  
- Transform data using **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)** or **T-SQL scripts** to ensure data quality and consistency.  
- Load transformed data into a structured data warehouse schema for analytics and reporting.

### 2. Data Modeling
- Implement **Star Schema** and **Snowflake Schema** designs for optimized querying.  
- Create **Fact Tables** to capture transactional or quantitative data.  
- Build **Dimension Tables** to store descriptive attributes for easy analysis.

### 3. Analytics and Reporting
- Write **SQL queries** to generate actionable business insights.  
- Perform **aggregations, KPI calculations, and trend analysis**.  
- Optionally integrate with BI tools such as **Power BI** or **Tableau** for advanced visualization.

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Apply **indexing** and **partitioning strategies** to improve query performance.  
- Optimize SQL queries to ensure faster analytics and reporting.
